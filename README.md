# JExciter
4 band harmonic exciter plugin.


You will need to run cmake on the project in the same fashion as any other aspik project. 
When your project is built you will need to drag in the linkwitz riley filter files into your project from source. 
If building in mac OS then the GUI will need to be redesigned slightly but plugin should function correctly.
